      The orca, also known as the killer whale, is actually the largest 
      member of the dolphin family. Orcas are highly intelligent and 
      social, living in family groups called pods that can number from 
      a few individuals to dozens. They are apex predators, meaning 
      they have no natural enemies, and they hunt cooperatively to 
      catch fish, seals, and even whales. Orcas are found in oceans 
      all over the world, from icy polar regions to warm tropical seas.
