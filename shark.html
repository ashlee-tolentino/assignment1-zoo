    <img src="img/shark.jpg" alt="Shark">
    <p>Sharks are a diverse group of fish that have lived in Earthâ€™s 
      oceans for over 400 million years. They have skeletons made of 
      cartilage instead of bone, which makes them lightweight and 
      flexible swimmers. There are more than 500 species of sharks, 
      ranging from the tiny dwarf lanternshark to the massive whale 
      shark. As top predators, sharks help maintain healthy ocean 
      ecosystems by keeping prey populations in balance.
