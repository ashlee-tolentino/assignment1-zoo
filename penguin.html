    <p>Penguins are flightless birds that are excellent swimmers, 
      using their wings like flippers to move quickly underwater. 
      Most species live in the Southern Hemisphere, especially Antarctica, 
      but some can be found in warmer climates. Penguins huddle together 
      in large colonies for warmth and protection. Their black-and-white 
      coloring helps them blend in while swimming, keeping them safe from 
      predators.
