    <p>The lion is often called the "king of the jungle," 
      even though it actually lives in grasslands and savannas 
      rather than forests. Lions are social animals that live in 
      groups called prides, which can include up to 30 members. 
      Male lions are known for their large manes, while lionesses 
      do most of the hunting. They are powerful predators and play 
      an important role in keeping ecosystems balanced.
